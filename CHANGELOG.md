### 2.0.0

- **BREAKING** - Arguments passed to the parser have changed, see [the docs](https://thesharks.github.io/JagTag-JS/interfaces/interfaces_iparserarguments.iparserarguments.html) for more information on the new parser arguments
- Typescript rewrite, resolves [#84](https://github.com/TheSharks/JagTag-JS/issues/84)
- Greatly improved compatibility with original JagTag notation
